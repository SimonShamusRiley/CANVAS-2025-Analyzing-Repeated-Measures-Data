## Downloading the Workshop Materials

Click on the big green button above that says "Code", and then select "Download ZIP". Now open the zip files and extract the contents, making sure to *save the files where you will be able to find them*, such as on the Desktop.

## Install all required software

For SAS users, you should have a licensed copy of SAS installed on your machine, or else you will need to have created an account with SAS OnDemand for Academics.

R users will need to have installed both R and RStudio, along with with the R packages:

`pkgs <- c('readxl', 'writexl', 'tidyverse', 'lmerTest', 'car', 'emmeans', 'multcomp', 'multcompView', 'ggResidpanel')
sapply(pkgs, install.packages)`

Please note that participants are expected to already have a basic understanding of either R or SAS, and those who are using new to using these programs or have not used them in a long time are strongly encourage to familiarize themselves with the basics before the workshop.
